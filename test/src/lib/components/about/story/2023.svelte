                As AI and machine learning, in combination with big data, became increasingly important for predicting trends among our industrial customers, we began searching for the most suitable platform to support them. It wasn't difficult to choose, as Databricks provides unique lakehouse technology that solves most data-related problems, is scalable, and supports our AI and machine learning ambitions. The logical step was to become a Consulting and Integration partner for Databricks. Inspirators! is an engaged Consulting and System Integration partner with Databricks, actively collaborating to bring advanced solutions to clients in Northern Europe and Germany.

                2023 was also the year when we were selected to be one of a dozen companies from Estonia to participate in the Estonian stand at the 'global innovation and industrial must-attend' Hannover Messe. The event was successful, affording us the opportunity to pitch our product, FutuDraw, at an industrial startup area.

                Financially, 2023 was also an excellent year for Inspirators!, as our revenue grew by more than 2.5 times compared to the previous year.
