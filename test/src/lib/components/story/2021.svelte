                In 2021, Inspirators! was founded as a tech company with a mission to provide smart and competitive solutions to industries. Our co-founders, Kristi and Allar, brought their extensive experience in IT licensing and services as well as building industrial, financial, and CAD solutions to establish a company that delivers high value to our customers.

                Although we received interest from investors, we decided to finance our startup from our own capital, and have since taken a practical approach in providing services and developing products that meet the needs of our customers. As a result, we have successfully launched two main products: FutuDraw, a CAD automation tool with hundreds of users, and Effectino, a factory management app used by the largest factories in the region.
